The deployment failed again.

I stared at the console logs like they owed me money. Somewhere deep in the 
stack trace, a blank line laughed at me. I wanted to scream. But I didn't. 
Instead, I took a deep breath and I lit a candle - cherry, one of my 
all-time favorites.

The flame calmed me more than coffee ever could. It danced, uncaring of my 
failure, tracing shadows across the desk like a lover's fingertips, as if
it was trying to say *"hey, you can always take another shot."*

Sometimes, code is like fire. It burns, it warms, it destroys. 
And tonight, I'm not fixing anything. I'm letting it all burn and 
starting again tomorrow.
