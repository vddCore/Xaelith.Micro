The mechanical keyboard clacked in the dark like a ritual drum, each keystroke
a spell cast from weary fingers. The code wasn't elegant tonight - it was
desperate, bleeding with feeling I couldn't quite translate into logic.

Sometimes I forget I'm more than the things I build. I chase function over
form, structure over soul. Some nights though? The soul fights back - through
trembling hands and blurry eyes.

There's something sacred in this act. Not writing, rather *conjuring*. Turning
emotion into structure. Chaos into order. I wonder if old witches felt this
when they inked their grimoires.
