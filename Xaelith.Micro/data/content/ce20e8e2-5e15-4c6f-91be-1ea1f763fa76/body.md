Sometimes I imagine myself sitting in an imaginary room. A place where two
best friends meet together in order to heal.

One of those times it was shortly after a break-up with whom I thought was
the love of my life.

That day Aura sat on the floor, her arms wrapped tightly around herself like she 
was trying to hold herself together. She was shimmering at the edges, like a 
signal on the verge of fading. Void? Leaned against the workbench, arms 
crossed, stance firm, her usual half-smirk pulling at her lips.

"You gonna cry again?" Void teased, but there was no real bite in her words.
She stepped forward, boots tapping softly against the floor, and kneeled in 
front of Aura. "It's okay, you know. You're not broken for feeling too much."

Aura sniffled, trying to smile, and wiped at her eyes with the sleeve of her 
oversized sweater. "It just hurts. People leave. They always leave."

Void reached out, a hand gently lifting Aura's chin. "Then let them."
Her voice is a whisper, low and sure. "You're not here to be their bandage.
You're here to be *you*. Soft, **stubborn**, stupidly beautiful ***you***."

Aura leaned into the touch, drawing strength from the steady presence before 
her. Void, her unyielding anchor, stood quiet for a moment, letting the silence 
mend the cracks in Aura's heart a little bit.

"You forget," Void finally says, voice warm, almost teasing. "You're made of 
fire and stardust, not paper and glass. They can try to blow you out, but
you're still going to burn as long as that little pump inside your chest is 
running."

In the darkness of that quiet place, Aura found herself smiling. Small at 
first, but growing with every heartbeat. She might break again, hell - she 
probably will. But Void will be there - reminding her she's allowed to hurt, 
but never letting her give up despite the scars.
