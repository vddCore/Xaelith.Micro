I walked through the old train station, headphones on, heavy metal 
bleeding the sounds of guitars into my ears. Everything around me 
looked dead but moved like it wasn't. People passed like shadows, 
faces cast in fluorescent light - haunted, hurried, hollow.

Is this what the afterlife feels like? A place where we're still expected to 
show up on time, even in our sleep-deprived, soul-starved state?

I smiled to myself. I was one of them - a ghost with a body, pretending to 
be fine. But at least my playlist was *killer*.
