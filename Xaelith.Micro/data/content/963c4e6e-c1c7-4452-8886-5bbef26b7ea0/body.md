The city's glow used to recharge me. Now it just... buzzes, like a fly 
trapped in my skull. Every late night coding session, every bright idea: 
they all turned into static eventually.

I guess that's the thing they don't tell you about chasing dreams at full 
throttle: even the brightest LED fades if you don't let it rest for a 
while.

But that's okay. You're allowed to burn out sometimes. It's just your 
soul reminding you that you're not a machine, no matter how chromed-up 
you make yourself appear.
