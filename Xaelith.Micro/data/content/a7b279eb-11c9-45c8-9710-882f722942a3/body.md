Hi. My real name is **Aura**. Some people also call me **V**.
As of 16.IV.2025 I prefer to call myself **Void**.

I am a computer programmer, but I don't limit myself to *just* programming.
It's boring when you do the same thing over and over again - I also do software
and hardware reverse engineering, electronic circuit design, 3D printing,
storywriting, poetry, lots of nerdy stuff. Whatever it takes to express myself.

### What I use to do my job
My main tools of trade when doing the usual things are JetBrains Rider, the C#
language and Avalonia. I love designing pretty, minimal UIs and creating the
best user experience possible. There's just something about it that gives me
lots of satisfaction... The focus on content and an efficient way to present it,
instead of everything else around it. I do "the nerdy stuff" with everything
else, to keep me out of burnout's way - compiler design, reversing of old
printer control chips and re-purposing LCD screens from other devices for
my own projects, fixing old consoles for myself and other people, creating
vibrant lights synced to audio... Anything that uses electricity is a way to
let the creative and logical me go wild.

### Personal preferences
I quite like the colors
<span style="color: #007ACC;">blue</span>, 
<span style="color: #ff1fe1;">pink</span> and 
<span style="color: #00ff3a;">green</span>. 
I really like visual minimalism, but you already knew 
that if you read the above paragraph or noticed 
something about this very website's theme. 

My favorite number is... any number I feel like in any given moment... I guess?
My favorite sauce is ketchup+mayo mix, sometimes BBQ. I love the freedoms of
the MIT license, but given its double-edged sword nature I've learned to love
the GPL and the likes more. I prefer dark color schemes over the light ones
for work - they are just more visually appealing to me.
