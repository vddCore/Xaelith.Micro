I found an old markdown note buried deep in my project folder - a letter to 
no one. A safety protocol. Written for the unthinkable: a heartbreak scenario. 
"Something unnecessary? Maybe? *Just in case...*" naive me thought at the time. 

```
### in case of emergency

0. isolate. 
1. cry.
2. try to delete.
3. fail to delete. 
4. keep going.
```

These files are the ghosts I keep. Invisible until I open the right directory. 
Then they haunt me like unfinished spells.

Perhaps that's what programming is. Not churning out apps, one after another.
Just finding new ways to organize grief.
