Building my own blog was a little like stepping into a shady back alley for the 
first time - thrilling and mildly terrifying. I'd always been a ghost, haunting 
other people's work without leaving much of a trace of my own.

Now, every component I craft, every page I publish, feels like carving my 
initials into the digital asphalt. It's messy, sometimes awkward, but damn 
if it isn't *mine*.

I don't know where this road leads yet. But I'm strapping in my synthwave 
playlist and riding this glitchy highway wherever it takes me.
