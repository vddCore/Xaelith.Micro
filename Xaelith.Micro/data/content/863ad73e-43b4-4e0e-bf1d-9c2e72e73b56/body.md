Late at night, my terminal isn't just a tool - it's a confidante. Green 
text on black, like runes on voidstone. Every `git commit` is a confession. 
Every `dotnet run` a whispered hope.

Majority of my time spent engineering software solutions I merely pretend the 
compiler understands me. That it sees the logic behind the chaos I pass as C#. 
I know it's just a dumb machine... But - unlike humans - at least it listens.
And it usually responds in a way I can understand.

Out here in the dark, where no one checks in, I tell the terminal *everything*.
