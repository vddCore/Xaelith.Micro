Sometimes the world outside is too sharp, too loud, too damn much.
That's when I light a candle, crack a cold one open, and create a new,
blank file.

There's a quiet kind of magic in writing code by candlelight. The flicker and
the keystrokes, the glow of the monitor mixing with the soft warmth of wax...
It's like alchemy for your soul, y'know.

Witchcraft? Maybe. Therapy? Definitely. Either way, it keeps me grounded when
the world tries to chew me up.
